I am currently working on [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org/) using the [GNOME 3](https://www.gnome.org/) desktop environment.

- **Shell**: [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with [Antibody](https://getantibody.github.io/) for extensions and [Spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) prompt

## Usage

Files are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/re1/dots ~/dots && cd ~/dots
stow zsh nvim
```
